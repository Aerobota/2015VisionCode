# 2015VisionCode #

This is Team 900s Vision Code for Recycle Rush.

The goal was to write code that would detect bins and find their location. This was done using cascade classifiers.
The final binary is cross platform and accelerates using a NVIDIA GPU whenever availble.

# Directories: #
1. bindetection - pretty much all the detection code
2. C920VideoCap - code for interfacing with the C920 Camera
3. camera_cal - ignore
4. cascade_training - #training data and code#
5. create_grayscale - ignore
6. detection for empty - old idea, ignore
7. framegrabber - useful utility to grab specific frame or percentage of frames
8. imageclipper - utility to grab parts of frames of a video. Contains README in folder
9. networktables - code for using network tables for interfacing with LabView on the RoboRIO
10. older detection methods - ideas that we tried before classifiers. You can look at it if you want, probably not very useful
